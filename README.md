# Voice-Digits-Classifier
Classifier of digits by voice in real time.
This was a university assignment for the "Speech Processing and Recognition" class. <br/>
Idea of project is to implement classifier of digits by voice in real time.

This classifier can recognize digits 1, 4 and 9 in real time. Simple GUI is also added for better user experience. 
GUI tells user which digit was spoken predicted by model.<br/>

Technologies that were used:
